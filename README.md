# 🚀 MPC Deadlines Hub

Welcome to the **MPC Deadlines Hub**, your one-stop destination for keeping track of the latest deadlines for top Multi-Party Computation (MPC) conferences, journals, and workshops! 📅✨

## 🤔 What is MPC?

Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) allows a set of mutually distrusting parties to perform a joint computation over their private inputs while preserving the privacy of their individual inputs. Curious to learn more? Check out this **[MPC overview](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/300)**! 🔍🔐

## 🚀 Adding/updating a conference

Want to contribute? Awesome! Here’s how:

* Read the data format description below. **Note that the timezone format sign is inverted** (e.g., UTC+7 is written as `Etc/GMT-7`). It's [not a bug][0]. Yeah, we know—it’s weird. If you have a better JavaScript timezone library in mind, hit us up! 😅
* Update `_data/conferences.yml`. You can do this directly on GitHub or locally after forking the repo.
* Send a pull request. 🎉

💡 **Too lazy to create a pull request?** No worries! Drop a message on our **[Telegram Group](https://t.me/+sm414tMmhGhhNTA0)** 📢, and we’ll update the entries for you! 😎🚀

### ✅ Is my entry in scope?

This page is meant to host academic conferences, journals, workshops, and related event deadlines.

Ask yourself these questions before adding an entry:

- 📝 Is there a "Call For Papers"? A submission link? Formatting guidelines (page limits, style guides, etc.)?
- 🔐 Does it mention 'secure multi-party computation', 'MPC', or 'privacy-preserving computing' in its topics?
- 🧐 Is there a peer-review process? Are there named general/program chairs or a program committee?

If you answered **YES** to all of the above, congratulations! Your conference/workshop is a great fit! 🎯

#### 📌 Special Case of Workshops

Workshops can be a bit special! Here’s what to keep in mind when adding them:

- If the workshop is **affiliated with a conference**, make sure to add the `conference` tag, specifying the name of the main conference. For example:
   ```
   conference: CCS.
   ```
  This helps keep things clear and organized! 🔍


### 🏷️ Tags - Shortlisting Made Easy! 🚀

We use three sets of tags that act as filters to help you quickly find relevant entries. 

- **First filter**: Research Domain (e.g., THEORY, PRACT, APPLIED, etc.)
- **Second filter**: Publication Type (e.g., CNF, JRN, WK, PS, etc.)
- **Third filter**: [CORE](https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) Ranking (e.g., COREAS, COREA, COREB, etc.)

For the full list of tags, check out [`/_data/filters.yml`](https://github.com/mpc-deadlines/mpc-deadlines.github.io/blob/main/_data/filters.yml). 🏷️

#### 🔥 Special Case: `EXP` Tag

For an event that has been **announced** but the Call for Papers is **not yet available**, you can still add an entry! Just make sure to:
- Include the `EXP` tag.
- Fill in details based on the **previous year’s** event.
- This will internally set some of the fields to default placeholder values (e.g., `comment: "CFP yet to be announced"`).

#### 🔥 Special Case: `EXPCFP` Tag

Sometimes, an event is already **confirmed** and has public details like **dates, location, and venue**, but the **CFP hasn't been published yet**. In this case, use the `EXPCFP` tag.

- This is a more specific version of the `EXP` tag.
- Use `EXPCFP` when the event is definitely happening, but the CFP is **not yet available**.
- As with `EXP`, base your entry on the most recent available details.

This helps signal to others that the event is expected, even though submission details are still pending. 🔍

🔥 **Let's make MPC deadlines easy to track—together!** 🚀
